# Yorks V1 R35 — Implementation Source of Truth

Status: **approved re-baseline**
Approved: 1 August 2026
Current delivery stage: **Batches 0–9 complete; Batch 10 local release
evidence passed. Staging acceptance, protected Android signing and deployment
remain release-owner activities. R39 Accounts was approved on 25 August 2026;
its T01–T07 protected server/domain/UI slices are complete. The release owner
explicitly authorized production web enablement on 26 August 2026 while the
tracked flag default remains off for unconfigured and CI builds. Workforce T01
through T13 were independently accepted by 31 August 2026. The product owner
initially waived, then reinstated, the dedicated Workforce T14 staging UAT
phase; both decisions remain historical and T14 has never been recorded as a
pass. Dedicated Frankfurt staging project `iqltcyimlqtcwyzlemwx` now carries
the complete tracked migration ledger and the protected document Function,
but named-persona/manual UAT is still not performed. Later on 31 August 2026
the product owner explicitly deferred that UAT until after release and
authorized production immediately as a recorded release exception. The
verified Workforce artifact was later followed by the access recovery,
Administration enablement and matched Daily Crew Timesheet design. The current
artifact from commit `0abe54e93c95d281a80c9a651986ed1e222156e0` is promoted
as deployment `dpl_3qFwJVMAQ11YNGdzdxLvg2o6PYQF` at
`yorks-r35.vercel.app`; this does not convert T14 into a pass.**

This folder is the repository-local contract for the Yorks V1 Procurement
Control and Inventory turnaround. Rev 2.0 supersedes the overlapping Nexus V7
product workflow. The existing V7 implementation remains valuable evidence and
a reuse source, but it no longer defines V1 behavior.

## Authority order

1. Yorks V1 SRS and Rapid Development Plan, Rev 2.0
2. Effective final R35 HTML behavior for non-conflicting UI and interaction
3. Yorks V1 Sol AI Execution Pack for delivery sequencing
4. [`PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md`](PRODUCT_DECISIONS.md) for resolved ambiguities
5. Current repository implementation as the reuse and migration boundary
6. `docs/nexus-v7/` as historical evidence and inherited non-conflicting
   security, migration, localization and non-regression safeguards

See [`SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md`](SOURCE_OF_TRUTH.md) for source fingerprints and the
explicit V7-to-V1 conflict resolution.

## Product north star

- Calm before clever.
- Information before decoration.
- Speed through familiarity.
- Confidence through transparency.
- Precision over personality.
- One source of truth.
- Familiar spreadsheet behavior for engineers without weakening server rules.

## Canonical R35 build configuration

Yorks V1 is the production experience by default. Supabase targets are
explicit: an unconfigured build stops rather than falling back to a shared
remote project. Configure the intended local, staging or production backend
once in an ignored file, then use the launcher without manual dart-defines:

```bash
cp tool/r35.env.example .r35.env
# Edit .r35.env with the chosen target's HTTPS URL and publishable key.
./tool/r35.sh run
./tool/r35.sh build-web
./tool/r35.sh build-apk
```

Use a separately named ignored configuration file for staging/production via
`R35_CONFIG_FILE=.r35.staging.env` or `.r35.production.env`. The tracked
`../../tool/r35.sh` launcher always supplies the complete R35 flags; do not add
legacy `NEXUS_V7_*` flags to an R35 command.

## Canonical operational chain

`Project -> BOQ -> MR Draft -> Submit -> Engineering Approval -> Arrange/Reserve -> Dispatch -> Delivery Order -> Receipt Review -> Return`

The Delivery Order snapshots a committed dispatch and is available immediately
after that dispatch. Receipt review records later good, missing and damaged
facts without rewriting the Delivery Order. Only historical requests that
already entered the former post-arrangement approval path retain that recorded
lane; new requests always use approval before Procurement arrangement.

R39 adds normalized project commercial-control Accounts through phases T01–T07
without changing this operational chain. T01 is additive/shadow-only; later
phases cut over tested Accounts surfaces behind `YORKS_V1_ACCOUNTS`. The
legacy `/admin/finance` route is not Accounts authority. The full
RFQ/quotation/PO and general-accounting suites are not part of V1.
Configuration, Rentals, User Management, Audit Trail, Duct Sizer and ESP
Calculator remain in place and receive regression coverage rather than
Accounts-driven redesign.

Workforce adds a separate phased chain behind `YORKS_V1_WORKFORCE`. T01 through
T04 are additive and route-less; T05 adds the guarded Supervisor Daily Roster.
T03 promotes `workforce.view` and
`workforce.attendance.maintain`; T04 promotes only
`workforce.timesheets.maintain` for protected allocation and later monthly-
validation RPCs. The remaining nine capability rows stay planned/shadow/
nonassignable. The tracked flag defaults off. Existing People/HR, Leave and
legacy attendance collections remain preserved and are not dual-written.

## How to execute a batch

1. Name the exact batch and acceptance slice.
2. Read `AGENTS.md` plus this README, source-of-truth and product decisions.
3. Read the task-relevant architecture/UI/migration/test sections.
4. Audit exact current files and symbols before editing.
5. Implement only the approved slice. Keep new work guarded until its
   acceptance gate passes; once accepted into the complete R35 chain, the
   canonical build configuration controls its default state.
6. Add migration/rollback notes, negative RLS tests and idempotency proof where
   applicable.
7. Run narrow checks and the complete applicable gate.
8. Report files, migrations, commands, evidence and limitations.

The rapid three-day grouping is a client-testable demo target. It is not a
waiver for RLS, transaction, migration, Android or production hardening.

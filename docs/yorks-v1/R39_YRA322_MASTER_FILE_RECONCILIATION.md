## Project identity decision

The commercial summary and progress worksheets consistently identify
`YRA-322` and the `N-19957.2` Nexus Phase 1 contract. The copied Project
Details sheet identifies YRA-315 and was quarantined as a conflicting source;
it was not allowed to overwrite YRA-322 project metadata.

The typo `N-1957.2` in `Summery (Option)!D2` was normalized to the dominant
`N-19957.2` reference already held by the project and repeated throughout the
workbook.

## Applied facts

| Fact | Workbook evidence | Applied value |
|---|---|---:|
| Contract baseline | `Summery (Option)!F52` | AED 17,192,000.00 |
| Buildings | DF3W, DF4W, DF6W, DF7W | 25% each |
| Billing stages | `D53:D57` | 10% / 50% / 30% / 5% / 5% |
| DF3W Design | `H9`, `I9`, `W9`, `X9` | 100% of stage / AED 429,800.00 |
| DF4W Design | `H20`, `I20`, `W20`, `X20` | 100% of stage / AED 429,800.00 |
| DF6W Design | `H31`, `I31`, `W31`, `X31` | 100% of stage / AED 429,800.00 |
| DF7W Design | `H42`, `I42`, `W42`, `X42` | 100% of stage / AED 429,800.00 |
| Overall confirmed work | `W58`, `X58` | 10.00% / AED 1,719,200.00 |

Baseline revision 1 already matched the workbook and was verified without
creating a replacement baseline. Four Design progress rows were confirmed
against the immutable source reconciliation. Material Supply, Installation,
Commissioning & Handover and Energizing remained zero.

## Active-baseline reconciliation

A later approved management-review-policy change created baseline revision 2.
Baseline versioning correctly materialized a new 20-row progress grid, so the
source confirmation remained preserved on superseded revision 1 while the
active projection returned zero progress. The two revisions retain identical
source-relevant commercial dimensions: contract value, currency, VAT,
payment/reminder terms, four 25% building allocations, and the 10/50/30/5/5
stage allocations. Only the review policy changed.

The 29 August correction therefore reapplies the four already-approved Design
facts to active revision 2. It links every new confirmation revision to the
same immutable source-import row and appends new audit events. It does not
rewrite revision 1, carry progress automatically between arbitrary baselines,
or infer a new suggestion actor.

## Deliberate exclusions

- `YRA32201` has an amount excluding VAT of zero. No claim or invoice was
  created.
- Approval, due and paid dates are blank/zero. No certification or payment was
  created.
- `45 days PDC` is a note without a PDC instrument, amount, reference or date.
  No PDC was created and the active Accounts policy was not changed.
- Four `YRA3220X` cells are future placeholders, not transactions.
- `Summery (Option)!H5` contains a date inconsistent with the other building
  periods. It was recorded as an anomaly and not used as an historical actor
  timestamp.

These exclusions remain in the immutable source-import row so a later user can
enter a real claim, certification, PDC or payment when actual evidence exists.

## Controls and rollback

Initial migration:
`20260828085441_yorks_r39_accounts_yra322_master_file_import.sql`

Active-baseline correction:
`20260829110327_reconcile_yra322_source_progress_to_current_baseline.sql`

The migration:

- verifies project, actor, baseline, building allocations and stage totals;
- records the source hash, exact extracted facts and all excluded facts;
- refuses to overwrite any existing non-zero confirmation;
- adds append-only progress revisions and audit events;
- is idempotent for the same project and workbook hash;
- denies direct source-import table access to browser clients.

The correction additionally:

- requires the immutable source facts to exist on superseded revision 1;
- requires revision 2 to be the active, dimensionally equivalent baseline;
- refuses to run if any current progress row has been edited or if any
  receivable/payable transaction exists;
- locks the project and complete progress grid before mutation;
- exposes no execution grant to browser or service API roles;
- confirms exactly four Design rows and verifies the resulting weighted total
  is exactly 10.0000% / AED 1,719,200.00;
- is an exact no-op when replayed after a successful reconciliation.

Rollback is corrective, never destructive: create new progress-confirmation
revisions returning the four Design rows to the approved replacement values,
retain the source-import and audit rows, and record the correction reason. Do
not delete the import ledger or its audit history.

## Initial production verification

The protected project Accounts projection returned:

- confirmed progress: `10.00%`;
- confirmed eligible value: `AED 1,719,200.00`;
- four Design rows at `100.0000%`;
- claims, invoices, certifications, PDCs and payments: `0`;
- four progress-import audit events and one source-import audit event.

Before the 29 August correction, a live read confirmed that revision 2 was
current and its fresh grid was still pristine: 20 rows at zero, no revisions,
and no Accounts transaction records. That fail-closed precondition made the
source reapplication safe.

## Active-baseline production verification

After linked migration `20260829110327` was applied, a direct protected
production query returned:

- current baseline: revision `2`, AED `17,192,000.00`;
- progress grid: `20` rows;
- Design: four rows at `100.0000%`, all linked to the immutable source import;
- Material Supply, Installation, Commissioning & Handover and Energizing:
  `16` rows at `0.0000%`;
- weighted confirmed progress: `10.0000%` / AED `1,719,200.00`;
- current-baseline source-linked progress revisions: `4`;
- cumulative import audit events: eight progress events and two source-import
  events (the original application plus the active-baseline correction);
- claims, invoices, certifications, client payments, PDCs, PDC events,
  supplier bills and supplier payments: `0`.

## Release evidence

- Local database reset and the complete pgTAP suite passed: 60 files and
  1,652 assertions. The two YRA-322 files contributed 19 passing assertions,
  including conflict, API-grant and exact-replay coverage.
- `flutter analyze` and the 18 focused Accounts/router tests passed.
- Accounts-enabled Flutter web and ephemeral-signed Android release builds
  passed; the Android artifact was 98.8 MB.
- Production database migration `20260829110327` is aligned in the local and
  remote ledgers. The post-deploy database advisor command completed without
  an error-level finding; its warning-level output is the existing broader
  schema backlog.
- Vercel deployment `dpl_9RnX6xtiLQhocA1F2xGP5Q9uMgNz` reached `READY` and was
  promoted to `https://yorks-r35.vercel.app`. Root, Accounts portfolio,
  billing-progress and the YRA-322 Accounts overview deep route returned HTTP
  200. The deployed index, bootstrap, manifest, service worker and application
  bundle matched the production build byte-for-byte.

The repository-wide Flutter run is not represented as globally green: 831
non-golden tests passed while four pre-existing 1024 px shell/overview tests
reported the same 139 px top-bar overflow; the golden lane also has unrelated
baseline pixel drift. Neither failure intersects this SQL-only reconciliation
or its focused Accounts gates.

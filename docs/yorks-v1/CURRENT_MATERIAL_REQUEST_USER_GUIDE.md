# Current Material Request User Guide

Status: **current operating guide**  
Authority: the approved approval-first revision in
[`MATERIAL_REQUEST_FLOW_REVISION_2026-08-13.md`](MATERIAL_REQUEST_FLOW_REVISION_2026-08-13.md)
and the protected server projection. Historical batch screenshots remain
evidence of their original releases, not current workflow authority.

## The flow in plain language

1. **Engineering prepares the request.** A Project Engineer or Site Engineer
   selects the project and exact Common/building scope, adds BOQ or custom
   items, saves a private Draft and explicitly submits it.
2. **Engineering approves the need.** An authorized Project Engineer reviews
   the submitted quantities and either approves them for Procurement or
   returns them for changes with a reason.
3. **Procurement arranges every line.** Procurement records Full, Partial or
   Cannot Provide Now and chooses Warehouse or External Supplier. Saving a
   complete arrangement makes its positive quantities ready for controlled
   dispatch; new requests do not need a second Engineering approval.
4. **Procurement dispatches approved quantities.** The server rechecks the
   approved outstanding quantity and warehouse availability, then commits one
   dispatch and creates its immutable Delivery Order quantity snapshot. The
   success notice identifies the committed dispatch.
5. **The site reviews the delivery.** An authorized receiving Engineer records
   Good, Missing and Damaged quantities for every dispatched line. The totals
   must exactly equal the dispatch. A confirmed receipt may include site
   photographs.
6. **Engineering closes resolved work.** When all required good quantities are
   received, an authorized Engineer closes the request. Missing or damaged
   quantities remain visible for replacement dispatch until resolved.
7. **Returns are a separate controlled flow.** Engineering selects eligible
   good-received material, submits a return, obtains Engineering approval and
   dispatches it back. Procurement confirms physical warehouse receipt before
   inventory is restored.

## Creating a request on a phone

The composer has three short steps: **Details**, **Items** and **Review**.

1. In Details, choose the project and exact Common/building scope first. The
   optional title, timing and delivery note stay with that request.
2. In Items, use **Add from BOQ** or **Add Custom Item**. The Material basket
   remains visible with its current count; tap a material to edit it. A custom
   item keeps description, quantity, controlled unit, Brand/Origin, Size and
   Planning Model/Tag visible together so no material detail is hidden behind
   an extra disclosure action.
3. In Review, check the scope and each quantity, confirm the review statement,
   then submit. Save draft remains separate from Submit. Procurement receives
   nothing until the protected Submit command succeeds.

## What the register tells you

Every request card shows four different facts:

- **Status** — where the request is in the immutable workflow.
- **Current owner** — the role that has authority for the next workflow step.
- **Next action** — the server-projected work needed to move the request.
- **Coordinator** — an optional person who follows up on the record. Claiming
  or reassigning a Coordinator never changes status, authority or Current
  owner.

The phone register begins with two simple views:

- **My Work** — the default. It shows records where you can perform the
  protected Current action now.
- **All Requests** — every request you are authorized to read.

Use the single **Filters** control when you need Exceptions, Coordinated
Requests or one workflow status. Search checks the visible project, request
number, title, scope, Current owner and Next action. This replaces the former
two horizontal tab rails, so narrow phones do not hide filters off-screen.

The role-aware filters answer a different question:

- **My Work** — records where you can perform the protected Current action
  now. It is based on server authorization, not only the owner label.
- **Exceptions** — current unavailable, partial, late-supply, receipt,
  replacement and return issues that need attention.
- **Coordinated Requests** — records assigned to you for follow-up; this does
  not make you the workflow owner.

When the server confirms that you can perform the Current action, the request
card shows a direct action such as **Continue draft**, **Review request**,
**Arrange items**, **Dispatch** or **Review delivery**. Opening the card still
shows the complete request and never bypasses the protected server command.

Open **Insights** for approval, arrangement, warehouse fill, receipt,
replacement and return timing facts. A Scheduled request shows its Required on
site date and a factual overdue warning. Action age is shown, but an Action due
date is not displayed until Yorks approves an SLA policy.

On a tablet, the register becomes a master/detail workspace. Select a request
on the left to review its status, Current owner and Next action on the right,
then choose **Open request**. Selection does not perform a workflow command or
load unauthorized detail; the full record is fetched only when it is opened.

## Simple and Full request views on a phone

Every committed request opens in **Simple** view. This keeps the Current owner,
Next action, key quantities and any Missing, Damaged or Still needed exception
close to the top. The protected action remains fixed above the phone safe area.

Choose **Full details** when you need the entire quantity ledger, actor history,
workflow timeline, discussion, recent activity, documents, logistics tools or
an authorized cancellation. This changes presentation only: it does not change
the request, its authority or its state, and no facts are removed.

## How to read the line ledger

The request detail keeps the complete quantity trail together:

`Requested | Arranged | Reserved | Dispatched | Good | Missing | Damaged | Returned | Still Needed`

This makes partial supply, goods in transit, receipt exceptions, warehouse
returns and outstanding need visible without comparing separate screens.

## Who does what

| Role | Main responsibility in this flow |
|---|---|
| Project Engineer | Create/edit requests, approve Engineering need, confirm receipts and close resolved requests for authorized projects |
| Site Engineer | Create/edit their request, confirm receipts and close resolved requests; cannot approve unless separately holding Project Engineer authority |
| Procurement | Arrange approved requests, reserve warehouse quantities, dispatch and confirm physical material returns |
| Admin | Audited administration/override through the same protected commands; does not fabricate missing workflow history |
| Global Engineering roles | Organization-wide Project Engineer authority as defined in the source-of-truth role matrix |
| Accountant | No technical MR, arrangement, dispatch, receipt or return mutation authority |

## How to read confirmations

Critical actions never succeed only on the screen. A success notice appears
after the protected server command returns:

- arrangement: counts Full, Partial and Unavailable decisions;
- dispatch: identifies the committed dispatch and line count;
- receipt: identifies confirmed lines and recorded exception lines;
- material return: identifies the return, resulting state and line count.

In Procurement arrangement, the register action is **Review arrangement**.
The actual **Save arrangement** command appears only after every line has an
explicit Full, Partial or Cannot Provide Now decision and its required source
or reason. This keeps navigation separate from the protected commit.

If a command times out or fails, refresh the record before retrying. The same
idempotency identity is retained until confirmation so a retry cannot create a
second reservation, dispatch, receipt or inventory movement.

## Historical requests

Records that already entered the former `awaiting_approval` post-arrangement
lane keep that factual history and compatibility path. They are not silently
converted. This exception must not be used as the operating guide for a newly
submitted request.

Implementation definitions and security boundaries are recorded in
[`MATERIAL_REQUEST_ACTION_INTELLIGENCE.md`](MATERIAL_REQUEST_ACTION_INTELLIGENCE.md).

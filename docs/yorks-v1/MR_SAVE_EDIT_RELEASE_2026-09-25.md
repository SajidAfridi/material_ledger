# Material Request Save edit release — 25 September 2026

An existing Project Material Request now offers **Save** to authorized editors.
For an approved request with an explicit, still-open edit grant, Save commits the
new version without sending it for another approval. The request remains
`approved_for_arrangement`, so Procurement may arrange its current saved lines.
New requests still require initial submission and approval. An edit to a
request awaiting its first approval remains in that queue. A legacy amendment
already pending reapproval is not silently promoted.

The trusted edit command checks the exact actor, membership/capability, grant,
state, arrangement cutoff and expected version under a request row lock. One
idempotency key returns one saved result. The initial Engineering decision is
retained with its original version; a post-approval edit creates a separate,
immutable revision snapshot and audit event with the editing actor and role.
Stable line IDs and protected commercial relations remain attached. An
incomplete or disconnected existing edit cannot report a local-only success.

The desktop, tablet and phone composers show Save alone for an existing
submitted request, with an editing title and a server-confirmed return to the
detail page. A new request keeps Submit for Approval. Request History labels
the saved edit; the approved status continues to describe the prior decision.

Migration `20260925031723_material_request_save_edits_without_reapproval.sql`
is forward-only and does not update existing requests or decisions. Rollback is
to revoke edit grants through the audited command and deploy a corrective
function migration; retain already committed snapshots and audit history.
Production database, deployment and data require separate explicit approval.

## Verification

Record local database, Flutter, build, staging migration and preview evidence
in the automation evidence package before a release decision. A staging preview
is not proof of production behavior. Test Project Engineer, Site Engineer,
Procurement, Admin, an ungranted user, revoked grants, version conflicts,
idempotent retries, simultaneous writers where available, and the transition
into arrangement. Confirm desktop and 360 px phone actions visually.

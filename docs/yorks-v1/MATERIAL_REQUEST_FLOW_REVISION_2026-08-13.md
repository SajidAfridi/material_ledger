# Material Request Flow Revision — 13 August 2026

Status: product-owner approved implementation contract.

This revision changes the order of Engineering approval and Procurement
arrangement for newly submitted Material Requests. It also adds an authorized
discussion thread with mentions, non-commercial inventory-assisted item entry,
clear lifecycle presentation, and operational receipt photographs.

## Evidence-backed impact and defect table

| Area | Current behavior | Approved behavior | Root cause / implementation impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| Request approval order | Submit hands the request to Procurement; Engineering approves the completed arrangement | Submit hands the request to Engineering; Procurement may begin only after request approval | The current state/RPC contract encodes `submitted -> arranging -> awaiting_approval`. New states and a new request-decision command are required; this cannot be solved by relabeling UI actions. |
| Stage-one editing | Only creator-owned `draft` rows are editable | Until request approval, the creator and an authorized Project Engineer may edit the Engineering request through a version-checked command | The existing draft RPC rejects every submitted record and has creator-only ownership. A separate trusted edit command must preserve the submitted number, attribution and audit history. |
| Arrangement completion | A saved arrangement waits for Engineering approval | A saved arrangement for a pre-approved request becomes dispatch-approved immediately; legacy arrangements retain their recorded post-arrangement decision path | The existing save command always creates `awaiting_approval`. It must branch on a real immutable request-approval record, never infer approval from state or role. |
| Discussion | Normalized V1 Material Requests have no trusted discussion relation | Authorized participants can comment from the first server-backed request stage, mention authorized users and generate notifications | Legacy JSON comments are not a transaction or RLS authority. New append-only comment and mention relations/RPCs are required. |
| Mention privacy | No scoped mention directory | Mention suggestions contain only authorized display name, exact role and opaque user ID for participants allowed to read that request | The broad profile directory is unsuitable: it excludes global Engineer roles and is not scoped to an MR/project. |
| Material-assisted request entry | Engineers enter custom description fields manually or search inventory only | One non-commercial project-authorized search ranks selected-scope BOQ, wider-project BOQ and then inventory; it copies descriptive data while preserving free text | BOQ scope identity must remain exact, cross-scope suggestions cannot masquerade as same-scope BOQ sources, protected stock/commercial facts remain absent and quantity remains user-entered. |
| Engineering visibility | Submitted request visibility follows existing project/global-role reads; drafts remain creator/Admin only | Active assigned Project/Site Engineers and organization-wide Senior Mechanical Engineers/Project Managers can read all server-backed workflow stages and discussion; private local recovery input remains creator-only | Read helpers and tests must explicitly cover all four Engineering roles without widening Procurement or commercial access. |
| Status clarity | State appears in parts of the workspace but the next owner/action is not consistently prominent | Detail and controlled form show a stable human status plus current owner and next action | Presentation currently maps the old state order and cannot distinguish pre-approval from arrangement review. |
| Close authority | Only Project Engineer/global Project Engineer roles and Admin can close a fully received request | An actively assigned Site Engineer may also close after all server quantity and receipt checks pass | Both the private authorization helper and presentation preflight must widen; the trusted close command, membership check, version, idempotency and audit boundary remain unchanged. |
| Tablet/mobile refresh | A healthy Realtime channel can appear subscribed after browser/app suspension while no longer delivering workflow signals | Re-fetch authorized projections on foreground resume and a low-frequency safety interval, retain the visible projection during refresh, and offer pull-to-refresh on the mobile register | Realtime remains metadata-only; every refresh reuses normal protected RPC reads and no local state transition is synthesized. |
| Receipt evidence | Receipt review records quantities/notes only | After server confirmation, an authorized receiving Engineer may attach JPEG, PNG or WebP site photographs linked to that immutable receipt review | The generic document pipeline does not currently accept `receipt_review` as a link/upload target. The existing prepare/upload/finalize boundary will be extended rather than bypassed. |
| Draft privacy | Assigned/global Engineering could discover another user's server-backed draft through shared project reads | Draft detail, list presence, discussion and mentions remain creator/Admin only until explicit Submit | A draft is unfinished personal work. The shared workflow begins at submission, not the first autosave. |
| Mixed receipt exception | One line can be only Received, Missing or Damaged | One line may record exact Good, Missing and Damaged quantities together; their sum must equal dispatched quantity | Physical deliveries commonly include both missing and damaged pieces on the same dispatch line. Splitting the requested item is needless work and weakens traceability. |
| All unavailable | A legacy all-unavailable approval could close the MR | Keep the arrangement editable by Procurement; only a deliberate Engineering/Admin cancellation with reason is terminal | Zero available supply is operational work, not evidence that the request is completed. |

## New-request state machine

```text
draft
  -> awaiting_request_approval
  -> approved_for_arrangement
  -> arranging
  -> approved
  -> partially_dispatched / dispatched
  -> partially_received / received
  -> closed
```

- Returning a request before approval moves it back to `draft` only through a
  trusted decision with a required reason. Its number, original submission
  attribution, decision history and audit events are retained.
- An edit in `awaiting_request_approval` replaces only the current Engineering
  line snapshot. It is version-checked, audited and forbidden after approval,
  after any arrangement exists, or after any reservation/dispatch activity.
- The request approval freezes the exact approved Engineering version. It does
  not create inventory reservations or commercial facts.
- Saving a complete arrangement for a request with a current approval creates
  approved line quantities from arranged quantities and makes positive lines
  dispatchable. Partial and unavailable decisions remain truthful exceptions.
- A complete arrangement with no positive line stays in Procurement work with
  the all-unavailable reason visible and editable. It closes only through an
  explicit, authorized cancellation, after which Procurement editing fails.
- Receipt review supports `mixed` with separately stored Good, Missing and
  Damaged quantities that reconcile exactly to the dispatched snapshot.

## Existing-data preservation

- Existing `arranging` and `awaiting_approval` requests continue through the
  former post-arrangement approval path. No synthetic pre-approval row is
  created and no reservation is released or replaced by this migration.
- The former post-arrangement approval controls are disabled in production.
  They remain behind the off-by-default
  `YORKS_V1_LEGACY_ARRANGEMENT_REVIEW` compatibility flag only while historical
  beta records are reconciled.
- Existing `approved`, dispatch, receipt, Delivery Order, return, document and
  audit records are unchanged.
- Existing `submitted` records without an arrangement are reclassified as
  `awaiting_request_approval`, because no Procurement fact exists to preserve.
  The migration records the system transition through the row version and
  timestamp without fabricating a human actor event.
- Rollback is forward-only: disable new client actions, retain additive tables
  and functions, and deploy a corrective migration. Do not drop comment,
  decision, mention, document-link or audit history.

## Authorization summary

- Creator: privately edit/comment on their own draft; after Submit, edit own
  request before approval and comment while request-readable.
- Assigned Project Engineer: read, edit, approve/return and comment.
- Assigned Site Engineer: read and comment; can edit only when they are the
  creator; may close a fully resolved received request; cannot approve unless
  separately holding valid Project Engineer authority.
- Senior Mechanical Engineer / Project Manager: organization-wide read,
  edit, approve/return and comment with exact role preserved.
- Procurement: reads/comments only after request approval, arranges and
  dispatches; cannot approve or edit Engineering intent.
- Admin: audited override within the same versioned commands; no fabricated
  actor events.

Temporary adoption policies approved for Phases 1-3:

- a non-Site-Engineer creator may self-approve only when they also hold valid
  Project Engineer/global Engineering/Admin authority; Site Engineer creators
  cannot self-approve;
- external supplier readiness is not yet a blocking completion gate; and
- Phase 3 exposes both policies as protected Admin configuration. Only a
  published version affects trusted commands; draft changes remain inert and
  prior actor, role, decision and supplier evidence is never rewritten.

## Acceptance additions

1. New submit produces `awaiting_request_approval`, not Procurement ownership.
2. Procurement begin-arrangement fails before request approval through RPC and
   ordinary table APIs.
3. Creator and valid Project Engineer edits are atomic, version-checked and
   audited; Site Engineer non-creator and Procurement edits fail.
4. Request approval is idempotent, preserves exact role and is required before
   the new arrangement path.
5. New arrangement save creates approved quantities once; a retry cannot
   duplicate approvals/reservations/audit.
6. Legacy awaiting-arrangement decisions remain resolvable without history
   rewrite.
7. Mentioned authorized users receive one notification; unauthorized or stale
   members cannot be mentioned or read the thread.
8. Ranked material search returns selected-scope BOQ, project BOQ and inventory
   in that order; it returns no costs, balances, reservations, minimum stock or
   other protected fields and fills only descriptive request data. No match
   continues as unrestricted free text.
9. Status/owner/next action are consistent across desktop, mobile and the
   controlled MR model.
10. Receipt photograph upload is available only after confirmed receipt and is
    readable only through the receipt/request project authorization boundary.
11. An actively assigned Site Engineer can close a fully resolved received
    request; Procurement and an unrelated or inactive Site Engineer cannot.
12. Tablet/mobile projections re-fetch after foreground resume and by safety
    interval without blanking the current view; mobile also supports pull to
    refresh.
13. Another Engineering participant cannot list, open, comment on or mention
    from a creator's draft; access begins only after Submit.
14. A mixed receipt stores separate Good/Missing/Damaged facts and rejects any
    under- or over-reconciled quantity set atomically.
15. All-unavailable remains Procurement-editable; explicit cancellation makes
    it terminal and a later Procurement save fails.

## Phase 2 collaboration and performance addendum

Phase 2 improves coordination and loading behavior without changing the
approval-first state machine:

- registers load lightweight authorized summaries in server pages of 15;
  search, filters, ordering and counts are server-authoritative, while full
  lines/comments are fetched only when a request is opened;
- the newest 20 comments load with the record and older comments use cursor
  paging;
- a valid request participant may claim responsibility or reassign it to an
  eligible participant with a reason. This is an audited coordination marker,
  not a state transition and not a substitute for workflow authority;
- an unsubmitted draft may sync privately to its creator's account while the
  existing local draft remains offline recovery. A stale server version is a
  visible conflict and never silently overwrites newer work;
- immutable Engineering revision snapshots derive the concise change summary
  shown after a request is returned and edited.

The temporary adoption choices above remain unchanged in Phase 2 and are
carried into Phase 3 as explicit policy inputs.

## Phase 3 policy and recovery addendum

Phase 3 completes the approved adoption controls without changing the familiar
approval-first sequence:

- `requests.allow_authorized_creator_self_approval` publishes whether a valid
  non-Site-Engineer creator may approve their own current request version. The
  default is `true`; publishing `false` requires another authorized
  Project Engineer/global Engineering/Admin actor. Site Engineer creators
  remain unable to approve in either mode;
- every positive External Supplier arrangement line can record **Source ready
  / firmly committed**, an optional expected date and an optional reference.
  `procurement.require_external_source_readiness` defaults to `false`; when an
  Admin publishes `true`, the server rejects an unconfirmed external line
  atomically. Supplier name remains optional;
- after Engineering explicitly cancels an all-unavailable request, an
  authorized Engineering creator may use **Create replacement request**. The
  server creates exactly one linked private Draft, clones the immutable request
  facts and line provenance, and leaves the source cancelled. Procurement has
  no replacement-create authority; and
- exact retries return the same result. A different command cannot create a
  second replacement from the same source, and neither path fabricates
  approval, arrangement, stock, dispatch or receipt history.

Phase 3 adds no automatic cancellation. Until Engineering cancels,
all-unavailable remains editable Procurement work exactly as established in
Phase 1.
